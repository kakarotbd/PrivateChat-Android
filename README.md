## ⚠️ **CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT STATUS & LIABILITY DISCLOSURE**

### **BETA DEVELOPMENT PHASE NOTICE**
This application operates in **ACTIVE BETA DEVELOPMENT**. Installation constitutes explicit acknowledgment of the following conditions:

- **Experimental Build Status:** Core functionality stable, but potential edge-case vulnerabilities may exist
- **Limited Liability Framework:** The development team assumes **NO RESPONSIBILITY** for:

## 🔑 **RECOVERY KEY PROTOCOL: THE NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE**

### **Critical Security Requirement**
During account creation, you receive a **12-Word Recovery Key** — your digital lifeline:

- **Immediate Secure Storage Mandatory:** Store physically and digitally in multiple secure locations
- **Absolute Recovery Dependency:** No alternative recovery methods exist (no emails, phones, or security questions)
- **Irreversible Consequence:** Recovery Key Loss = Permanent Account Termination + Complete Data Irretrievability
- **Zero Exception Policy:** We cannot and will not recover accounts under any circumstances

### **Recommended Storage Protocol**
1. **Physical Copies:** Waterproof/fireproof safe, safety deposit box, engraved metal plates
2. **Digital Copies:** Encrypted USB drives, password manager with 2FA, encrypted cloud storage
3. **Redundancy Minimum:** Three separate secure locations (minimum requirement)
4. **Access Control:** Share only with trusted individuals under explicit conditions
